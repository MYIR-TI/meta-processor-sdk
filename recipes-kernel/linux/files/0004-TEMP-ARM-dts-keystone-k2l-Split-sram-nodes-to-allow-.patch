Subject: [PATCH 4/4] TEMP: ARM: dts: keystone-k2l: Split sram nodes to allow
 section for CMEM use

Currently the reg entry in kernel dtb reserves the whole MSMC ram range
to be used only through the mmio-sram driver.

Given that other modules (like CMEM) also currently reserve memory from
MSMC, the reg entry which takes over the whole memory breaks those
functionality.
This patch will allow module like CMEM to reserve and use a non-
overlapping section of memory not marked reserved by the sub nodes here.
And is a workaround to unblock functionality.
Final solution is to implement functionality in CMEM driver to use sram
sub nodes directly.

Resolves current issue with CMEM module reporting error allocating MSMC
memory.
