Subject: [PATCH 207/210] arm: dts: am572x-idk-pps: add gmac/cpts pps
 output-controlled gpios

A gpio-controlled multiplexer is added to guarantee that there is only
one PPS output at any time at the AM571(2)x-idk. There is also a
gpio-controlled AND gate added for CPTS 1PPS reference signal control.

This patch adds GMAC/CPTS-related gpio entries.
